#Read With Comix
Calibre plugin (Linux only). 

This plugin helps integrate Calibre and Comix/MComix for better reading experience. For selected books with CBR/CBZ format it creates a folder of numbered symlinks in /tmp, and then opens the first one, so Comix can automatically open the next file when you're reading.
